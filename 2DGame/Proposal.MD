# Proposal

Project Requirements

What will (likely) be the name of your game? – If you are basing your game on an existing game, please let me know. You can still name your implementation whatever you wish.
- Mosquito (Population control) 

- Think Rain World, Plants vs Zombies, those iPad ant games where you kill it by smashing the screen

In a paragraph or two, tell me about your game and your implementation.
Good outcome deliverable – Write a list of features of what you WILL achieve no matter what.
- [Story] You are a professional ~~mosquito hater~~ (eco-system population control exterminator) and was hired to different botanical gardens or parks to kill some mosquitos. You have a special mosquito magnifying glass that shows you where all the mosquitos are (human-sized!). The game will load into a garden scene where you (can deploy up to 2 sticky traps,) have a bottle of mosquito spray, and your trusty (gloved) hand 

* Timer (As long as the 'park etc' is open, < 1 minute)
* 'Garden scene' 
* WASD on the player, space bar for using bug spray/slapping, (shift for deploying bug trap)
* Some mosquitos are chasing you to get your blood, some are just chilling around flowers
* Number of mosquitos killed 
* High score system for how many mosquitos killed within 1 minute
* Bags of blood (in replacement of hearts) 
* Mosquitos spawning from ponds or randomly, up to 4 in a scene at once, 2-3 are usually on you because they smell professional blood

Better outcome deliverable – Expand your previously written list of features to include what you THINK you will accomplish before the project’s deadline.
- You get to deploy up to 2 sticky traps anywhere (takes 1.5 seconds to place, hold down shift, if mosquitos touch you, it stops your progress + takes a bag of blood) and when mosquitos are chasing you, you can run over it but the mosquitos will get trapped, it can catch up to 3 mosquitos, then it disappears 

* Bug spray level meter
* Bags of blood (in replacement of hearts) 
* NPCs you have to save from mosquitos 
* Up to 3 'garden scenes' that will randomly spawn each time you start the single player game 
* WASD on the player, space bar for using bug spray, if it's close proximity, space bar switches to a slap, shift for deploying bug trap
* Mosquitos spawning from ponds or randomly, up to 4 in a scene at once, 2-3 are usually on you the rest on other NPCs or chilling 

Best outcome deliverable – Expand your previously written list of features to include what you HOPE you will accomplish before the project’s deadline.
- I would like this to be both a single player and multiplayer game. As a choice in the menu. For the singleplayer: you are the human exterminator and you deploy traps, kill mosquitos, save humans from getting bitten.
- For multiplayer, it is in the middle of the night, you and a friend will play as the human and the mosquito where you both will try to kill each other ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ A random timer of 5-8 seconds will be given to each player as the 'vulnerable' state where one can kill the other, think Pacman but without a grid
- Sounds for satisfying mosquito dying crunch sounds
- Funny UI commentary, if you lose etc, if you win, when you get bitten, when an NPC gets bitten and dies!!!! 

In a paragraph or two, outline your next steps and tell me what additional skills you will require and what topics you might research for the completion of this project.
- I will have to check out assets, wether there are anything mosquito-like, for the bug spray level meter, the traps, blood?  
- I will learn to have different enemy behaviour for different types of mosquitos, all their stats, what kills them and decide how many mosquitos can be caught in the trap...  
- How do you win this game? Different modes of the game? 
- Honestly, this idea made me researched about mosquitos and their place in the ecosystem. Out of their 3500 different species, only 100 are harmful to humans. So, other than coding techniques etc, I would like to research on different types of mosquitos, the ones that carry disease, the ones that only are attracted to sugar not blood...
