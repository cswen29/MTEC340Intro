# Proposal
## Shao Wen Nov 2023

What will (likely) be the name of your game?
- DICUL  

In a paragraph or two, tell me about your game and your implementation.
- DICUL is a 3D Maze game inspired by games like [Chants of Sennaar](https://youtu.be/__hzPH3tcvA?si=GNq0xpzCbLvrK_G8), [AntiChamber](https://youtu.be/am52_V_Phh4?si=7eLwR-v5DO50nvZ5) and [Manifold Garden](https://youtu.be/9IuErL1hJhQ?si=r038Vo96iKDO7JJS) . There will be a start and beginning which is how you win the game, you can interact with blocks to place them at certain spots (RayCast). More games to reference are: Portal (for the interactivity with blocks) and Monument Valley (for stairs and illusion)

Good outcome deliverable – Write a list of features of what you WILL achieve no matter what.
- An indoor maze
- Teleportation 
- Able to walk, run, pick up items place items, (not sure if I should allow player to jump or craawl yet)
- Intro scene, main scene, control scene, end scene 
- Sound Design
- A crosshair

Better outcome deliverable – Expand your previously written list of features to include what you THINK you will accomplish before the project’s deadline.
- There are guards around the maze, which will send you to the start point if they get you, they are just there to stop you from leaving this maze 
- Sliding doors that open and close when blocks are put in place 
- Some doors that open and close repeatedly where you have to run through without being crushed
- Pathways like stairs change and move overtime, so like in Harry Potter 
- I want to include fake walls and stairs that are illusion, that you can walk through as short cuts (only for people who actually explore) 
- Crosshair that changes color dynamically when on different surface for clarity

Best outcome deliverable – Expand your previously written list of features to include what you HOPE you will accomplish before the project’s deadline.
- Allow players to have an achievement log where there will be easter eggs hidden around the maze, I don't want it to just be a normal maze, I want there to be some lore, some history, something to learn no matter if you hit a dead-end, just some interesting facts here and there, so text on walls (looking into downloading fonts) 
- Gravity shifting, where if they stand close to a wall, it will flip and they can then walk on the wall 
- Guards to have a beak, so to see which direction they are looking at like in Monument Valley the birds 
- Music that progresses, the closer you get to the exit, the grander it gets ? 
- I would love to have a beautiful winning end scene, where when you finally get out of the building, it switches scene to where you see the outside, but everything is up side down, so you were defying gravity the whole time 

In a paragraph or two, outline your next steps and tell me what additional skills you will require and what topics you might research for the completion of this project.
- I believe the hard part would be creating the maze itself, whether there should be multiple ways to exit, a classic normal maze, or several floors, etc I want simple simple puzzles, the maze should be an experience 
- I will have to check out level design, to make this look good, I have a lot of art style in mind but not sure whether I can carry it out just by myself. I like the minimalistic styles too but I hope I can achieve the look
- I will have to learn how to interact with cubes and placing items, using Portal and Manifold Garden as references
- I will have to look into gravity that works like in Manifold Garden
